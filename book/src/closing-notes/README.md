We hope that this book served as an inspiration for addressing some of the
problems you and your team might be facing and rethinking the techniques you are
practicing or might be missing.

## An evolving Document

This book is the result of experience we made over the course of many years
working on many different projects with clients around the world. We did not
know everything we present here up-front but only discovered and formalized the
techniques as we went through problems that we needed solutions for to ensure
things would go smoother the next time. That learning process will continue and
as that happens will we update this book. We might also add content on
completely new topics that we are not covering at all in the moment like hiring
or effective and enjoyable communication.

Keep an eye on [https://simplabs.com/playbook](https://simplabs.com/playbook)
for updates.
