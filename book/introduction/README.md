# Introduction

This book is a guide for developing digital products following a proven
procedure as well as running an effective and low overhead product development
process. It describes what we do at simplabs and is based on experience we made
while working on digital products for international clients in various
industries.

Most teams working on digital products face the same challenges – be it an
inability to ship features effectively and with high quality, providing good
insight into timelines and meeting stakeholder's expectations or preventing
technical debt to accumulate. We believe that the techniques and practices we
present in this book will prove helpful for anyone developing digital products
of any kind in any industry – whether you are a CTO of an established company, a
founder looking to set up their own product team, a product manager, designer or
developer.

Of course the techniques that work great for one team might not work as well for
another one. That is why instead of focussing on any precise tasks and tools, we
focus on the underlying values and techniques that are independent of any
particular tools or organizational structure. Whether you are running a small
team of only a few people or a large organization, whichever of the plethora of
tools for organizing software teams you are using, you should be able to adopt
the techniques presented in this book.
