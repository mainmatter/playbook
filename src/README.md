This document describes how we work. Our process is based on patterns and values
that we acquired and defined over years of working with clients on a variety of
projects. We have found our method to result in smooth execution and great
output.

## [Project Procedure](./project-procedure#project-flow)

The document [Project Procedure](./project-procedure#project-flow) describes how we approach
new projects and work with clients. We aim for a smooth start encouraging our
clients to take on an active role.

## [Development Process](./development-process#development-process)

The document [Development Process](./development-process#development-process) specifies on how we
prepare and run iterations (commonly known as _"sprints"_ , we made a conscious
decision to avoid this term because it implies undesirable practices). We ensure
all project stakeholders are being listened to and are involved in every
iteration. Like this every task is well understood, clearly scoped and assessed
for hidden risks before getting planned.
