This document describes how we work. Our process is based on patterns and values
that we acquired and defined over years of working with clients on a variety of
projects. We have found our method to result in smooth execution and great
output.

## [Project Procedure](./project-procedure#project-flow)

The document [Project Procedure](./project-procedure#project-flow) describes how
we approach new projects and work with clients. We aim for a smooth start
encouraging our clients to take on an active role.

## [Development Process](./development-process#development-process)

The document [Development Process](./development-process#development-process)
specifies on how we prepare and run iterations (commonly known as _"sprints"_ ,
we made a conscious decision to avoid this term because it implies undesirable
practices). We ensure all project stakeholders are being listened to and are
involved in every iteration. Like this every task is well understood, clearly
scoped and assessed for hidden risks before getting planned.
