This document describes how we work. Our process is based on
patterns and values that we acquired and defined over years of working
with clients on a variety of projects. We have found our method
to result in smooth execution and great output.

## [Project Procedure](./project-procedure)

The document [Project Procedure](./project-procedure) describes how we approach
new projects and work with clients. We aim for a smooth start encouraging our clients to take on an active role.

## [Development Process](./development-process)

The document [Development Process](./development-process) specifies on how we
prepare and run iterations (commonly known as _"sprints"_ , we made a
conscious decision to avoid this term because it implies undesirable practices). We
ensure all project stakeholders are being listened to and are involved in every iteration. Like this
every task is well understood, clearly scoped and assessed for hidden risks
before getting planned.
