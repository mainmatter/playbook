# simplabs Playbook

This document describes how we work. All of it is based on patterns and values
that we discovered and defined over years of working with clients on all kinds
of projects and that we have found to result in smooth execution and great
output.

## [Process](./process)

The [Process document](./process) describes how we prepare and run iterations
(often referred to as _"sprints"_ but we think that's a horrible term). We make
sure all project stakeholders get heard and contribute to an iteration and
every task is well understood, clearly scoped and assessed for hidden risk
before it gets planned.

## [Workflow](./workflow)

The [Workflow document](./workflow) describes what the day-to-day work of our
[designers](./workflow/design) and [engineers](./workflow/engineering) looks
like. We value communication, collaboration and shared ownership of code and
design deliverables.
