# simplabs Playbook

This document describes how we work. All of it is based on patterns and values
that we discovered and defined over years of working with clients on all kinds
of projects and that we have found to result in smooth execution and great
output.

## [Project Flow](./project-flow)

The [Project Flow document](./project-flow) describes how we approach new
projects and work with clients. We target a smooth start with minimal overhead
and encourage our clients to take on an active role.

## [Process](./process)

The [Process document](./process) describes how we prepare and run iterations
(referred to as _"sprints"_ elsewhere but we think that term implies practices
we want to avoid and therefore don't use it). We make sure all project
stakeholders get heard and contribute to an iteration and every task is well
understood, clearly scoped and assessed for hidden risk before it gets planned.

## [Workflow](./workflow)

The [Workflow document](./workflow) describes what the day-to-day work of our
[designers](./workflow/design) and [engineers](./workflow/engineering) looks
like. We value communication, collaboration and shared ownership of code and
design deliverables.
