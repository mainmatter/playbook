# Consulting Projects

For consulting projects we work within our clients' organizational structures,
supporting or leading product initiatives and making the client's in-house teams
more efficient.

## Introduction

Following the kick-off meeting with all stakeholders we ask our clients to
introduce their business by explaining the problems they are solving, what's the
value for their customers, what differentiates them from their competition etc.
That will typically be done by one of the client's business experts sitting
together with our team and walking them through the key aspects of the business.
Even though this knowledge may not be directly relevant to the work we're doing,
it is essential for us to understand the environment our clients are operating
in to enhance our decision making and properly balance our efforts between
individual aspects during the project.

### Engineering Context

Our consultants will work closely with the client's teams within their
engineering infrastructure and often cooperate on existing applications and
systems. In order to guarantee maximum efficiency in a new environment, they
must know and understand its constituent parts. Therefore we ask clients to
introduce our consultants to:

- their in-house team structure and development process (for clients lacking an
  effective process, we offer to introduce
  [ours](./../../development-process#development-process))
- their engineering infrastructure, covering tools like version control systems,
  issue trackers, continuous integration and continuous deployment setups, VPNs
  etc.
- a comprehensive overview of the fundamental system architecture, covering
  everything from the database to message bus systems, external APIs, the main
  backend system(s), frontend application(s) etc. - like the introduction to the
  basic concepts of the client's business, this information may not be directly
  linked to our consultant's daily work but still provides valuable context
- a more detailed explanation of the architecture and design of the
  application(s) our consultants will directly be working with; if there are any
  known issues with the application, we ask our clients to explain those to us
  as well

Our consultants also require accounts with access to all relevant systems and
tools our clients use.

### Application Review

For most consulting projects, our consultants will work on one or more
pre-existing applications. This requires a decent amount of familiarity with the
codebase of these applications to be as effective as possible. We usually
recommend our consultants to take a little extra time at the beginning of a
project to familiarize themselves with the applications and the codebases,
setting up their local development environment as well as potentially required
accounts and data. Including this as a dedicated step in advance instead of
being part of the consultants' first contributions to the codebase, allows for a
smoother start.

Additionally, as our consultants are getting themselves set up and have acquired
a more in depth understanding of the codebase, we recommend them to review the
application's code for noticeable or problematic patterns simultaneously. Like
that they will often be able to identify the causes of existing issues and
impediments as well as uncover new and previously unknown problems. For each of
the review findings we will provide an explanation going into detail on the
findings' negative effects, recommend a way of addressing the issue as well as
supply an assessment regarding the severity along with a recommended priority
for addressing the respective finding. To conclude the review, we will schedule
a meeting with the client's in-house team to explain and discuss the outcome of
the review.

After the introductory phase has been completed with the review we proceed with
the project's main phase, which is either Team Augmentation or delivering a
particular project for the client.

## Team Augmentation

For Team Augmentation projects, our consultants merge with the client's in-house
product team. They will integrate with the client's internal organizational
structure like any internal employees for four days a week (since we reserve 1
day per week for our open source contributions), providing their knowledge and
experience to the team and thus increasing the team's velocity and output
quality.

### Regular on-site time

Our consultants are distributed and we work with our clients remotely. Since
Team Augmentation is driven by close collaboration between our consultants and
the client's team, we recommend for our consultants to spend some time on-site
with the client's team on a regular basis (a good interval being a few days
every 6 weeks). Maintaining the personal relationship between all team members
additionally improves efficiency for collaboration. We also encourage our
consultants to spend the first week of the project on-site with the client's
team to guarantee a smooth start.

### Leveling up

Team Augmentation projects deliver twice the value for our clients and their
teams. Our consultants will actively support the client's team with new and
ongoing product initiatives, thereby increasing the team's velocity while
simultaneously sharing their unique expertise and leveling team members up as
they collaborate. That way they provide sustainable value that our clients
continue to benefit from even after our consultants leave.

We apply a number of techniques in order to share our experience and knowledge
but also make teams more effective:

- pair programming with the clientâ€™s developers for face-to-face guidance; this
  can be done on-site but also remotely
- reviewing pull requests, giving detailed feedback, explanations and context so
  that the team internalizes best practices and patterns
- performing workshops and demos on particular topics that we notice the team
  struggling or lacking experience with
- identifying and removing impediments that negatively affect the team's
  productivity
- identifying and fixing quality issues in the app that lead to suboptimal
  results

## Training and Tutoring

For clients that can not or do not want to commit to a full team augmentation
project for an extended period of time, we also offer more concise and more
time-efficient training and tutoring engagements. In that case, our consultants
will not actively work with the client's team on any product initiatives but
only provide them with the ability to successfully deliver those themselves,
focussing on:

- performing workshops on topics that the team is struggling with or that have
  been identified as problematic in the initial review
- developing prototype implementations that adress problems that the client's
  team is unsure how to deal with themselves; these will often be followed up by
  a workshop in which the prototypes serve as a concrete example for the
  respective general topic
- scheduled availability of our technology experts (e.g. 1 day per week) for
  pairing with the client's engineers, Q&A sessions in which concrete questions
  and problems can be discussed, etc.

We generally tailor all training and tutoring engagements specifically to our
client's needs, ideally addressing specific problems they might already be aware
of and introducing possible strategies to solve those issues while also
improving upon the underlying principal theory.
