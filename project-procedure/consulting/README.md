# Consulting Projects

In consulting projects, we work within our clients' organizational structures,
supporting or leading product initiatives and making the client's in-house teams
more efficient.

## Introduction

Following the kick-off meeting with all stakeholders, we ask our clients to give
us an introduction to their business, explaining the problems they are solving
and why that is valuable for their customers, what differentiates them from
their competition etc. That will typically be done by one of the client's
business experts sitting together with our team and walking them through the key
aspects of the business. While this knowledge may not be directly relevant to
the work we're doing, it's essential for us to understand the environment our
clients are operating in as that helps us make better decisions and put
appropriate weight on individual aspects during the project.

### Engineering Context

Our consultants will work closely with the client's teams, within their
engineering infrastructure and often touch on existing applications and systems.
In order to be most effective in that new environment, they must know and
understand its constituent parts. Therefore we ask clients to introduce our
consultants to:

- their in-house team structure and development process (for clients lacking an
  effective process, we can introduce [ours](./../../development-process))
- their engineering infrastructure, covering tools like version control systems,
  issue trackers, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment setups, VPNs
  etc.
- a high-level overview of the overall system architecture, covering everything
  from the database to message bus systems, external APIs, the main backend
  system(s), frontend application(s) etc. - like the introduction to the
  fundamentals of the client's business, this information may not be directly
  linked to our consultants daily work, but is valuable as context
- a more detailed explanation of the architecture and design of the
  application(s) our consultants will directly be working with; if there are any
  known issues with the application, we ask our clients to explain those to us
  as well

Our consultants will also require accounts and access to all relevant systems
and tools our clients use.

### Application Review

In most consulting projects, our consultants will work on one or more
pre-existing applications. This requires good familiarity with the codebase of
these applications to be most effective. We usually recommend our consultants
take a little extra time at the beginning of a project familiarizing themselves
with the applications and the codebases, setting up their local development
environment as well as potentially required accounts and data. Having this as a
dedicated step, instead of part of the consultants' first contributions to the
codebase, allows for a smoother start afterwards.

Also, as our consultants are getting themselves set up and have a more in depth
look at the codebase, we recommend they review the application's code for
noticeable or problematic patterns at the same time. Doing that, they will often
be able to identify the causes of existing issues and impediments as well as
uncover new and previously unknown problems. For each of the review findings, we
will give an explanation going into detail on the findings' negative effects,
recommend a way of addressing the issue as well as provide an assessment for the
severity along with a recommended priority for addressing the respective
finding. To conclude the review, we will schedule a meeting with the client's
in-house team to explain and discuss the outcome of the review.

After the introductory phase has been completed with the review, we continue to
the project's main phase, which is either Team Augmentation or delivering a
particular project for the client.

## Team Augmentation

In team augmentation projects, our consultants merge with the client's in-house
product team. They will integrate with the client's internal organizational
structure like any internal employees for four days a week (as we reserve 1 day
per week for our open source contributions), bringing their know-how and
experience to the team and thus increasing the team's velocity and quality of
output.

### Regular on-site time

Our consultants are distributed and we work with our clients remotely. Since
Team Augmentation is driven by close collaboration between our consultants and
the client's team, which is made more efficient by a good personal relationship
between all team members, we recommend for our consultants to spend some time
on-site with the client's team on a regular basis (a good interval being a few
days every 6 weeks). We also recommend our consultants spending the first week
of the project on-site with the client's team for a smoother start.

### Leveling up

Team Augmentation projects deliver double value for our clients and their teams.
Our consultants will actively support the client's team with new and ongoing
product initiatives, thereby increasing the team's velocity whilst sharing their
unique expertise and leveling team members up as they collaborate. That way they
provide sustainable value that our clients continue to benefit from even after
our consultants leave.

We apply a number of techniques in order to share our experience and know-how
and make teams more effective:

- pair programming with the clientâ€™s developers to guide them face-to-face; this
  can be done on-site but also remotely
- reviewing pull requests, giving detailed feedback, explanations and context so
  that the team internalizes best practices and patterns
- performing workshops and demos on particular topics that we see the team
  struggling or lacking experience with
- identifying and removing impediments that negatively affect the team's
  productivity
- identifying and fixing quality issues in the app that lead to suboptimal
  results

## Training and Tutoring

For clients that can not or do not want to make the commitment for a full team
augmentation project for an extended period of time, we can also conduct
narrower and more temporary training and tutoring engagements. In that case, our
consultants will not actively work with the client's team on any product
initiatives but only enable them to successfully deliver those themselves,
focussing on:

- performing workshops on topics that the team is struggling with or that have
  been identified as problematic in the initial review
- developing prototypical implementations addressing problems that the client's
  team is unsure how to address themselves; these will often be followed by a
  workshop in which the prototypes serve as a concrete example for the
  respective general topic
- scheduled availability of our technology experts (e.g. 1 day per week) for
  pairing with the client's engineers, Q&A sessions in which concrete questions
  and problems can be discussed, etc.

We generally tailor all training and tutoring engagements specifically to our
client's needs, ideally addressing concrete problems they might already have and
introducing possible strategies for solving those and the foundational theory
behind them.
