# Project Flow

Successful projects require a well-defined procedure that clearly prescribes
which steps to take in what order and involves all stakeholders. All the
relevant information to each step and the respective outcomes need to be
accessible to everyone involved at all times.

## Kick-Off Meeting

Every project starts with a kick-off meeting assembling all
project stakeholders - ideally in person otherwise
in a video call. The main goal of this meeting is for all contributors to get to
know each other and to acquire an understanding of everyone else's roles, responsibilities and
goals. The group of project stakeholders should be kept as wide and open as
possible and also include people that might not necessarily be involved in the
project on a daily basis but still have relevant perspectives that the project
team should be aware of.
