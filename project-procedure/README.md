# Project Flow

Successful projects require a well-defined procedure that clearly prescribes
which steps to take in what order and involves all stakeholders. All the
relevant information to each step and the respective outcomes need to be
accessible to everyone involved at all times.

## Kick-Off Meeting

Every project starts with a kick-off meeting assembling all project
stakeholders - ideally in person, otherwise in a video call. The main goal of
this meeting is for everybody involved to get to know each other and to acquire
an understanding of everyone else's roles, responsibilities and goals. The group
of project stakeholders should be kept as wide and open as possible and also
include people that might not necessarily be involved in the project on a daily
basis but still have relevant perspectives that the project team should be aware
of.
