# Conception Workflow

TODO

### Discovery Workshop

The purpose of the design process is to produce a desired change. The change
could be many things, such as an improvement of user's attitudes towards a new
product or service, or an increase in visitor's engagement for a website.
Whatever prevents this change, and falls within our solution capabilities
(solved by software solutions), is going to be framed as the problem.

Therefore, an early step of our process is to identify the problem that needs to
be solved and the different variables surrounding this problem. The information
gathered during this workshop will help the team to be clear about what solution
needs to be developed.

As a result of this workshop, we should agree on the following:

- What the problem is
- Who is affected by the problem (e.g., end-users, support team, sales)
- How is the problem manifesting in the business (e.g., user feedback, low
  engagement, churn)
- What will the situation look like if the problem is solved or the solution is
  effective

#### What is needed for this workshop?

- Problem-specific information

Knowledge of the client's business and its context is needed to get at the
source of the problem. If specific information is required, the client needs to
provide it before the workshop. The designers will also gather information
through various means, such as interviews, observations, and reviews of existing
solutions.

- Pre-Workshop Client Goals Questionnaire

Understanding what change the client wants to achieve is essential for
determining the Discovery workshop activities. For that reason, we might request
that they fill out a questionnaire before we begin to structure the workshop.
Once we get the answers, we analyze them and use them to define an efficient
workshop agenda.

#### What happens during the workshop?

- **Facilitated discussion**

Discuss the information gathered previous to the meeting. Present all patterns
and insights uncovered during research to create a common understanding of the
problem context.

- **Goals Analysis**

Discuss the client's goals to determine how they are doing and how they should
be doing. If a gap exists, then we should determine the causes.

- **Set criteria for selecting a solution**

Not all gaps can be fixed at the same time, and some require solutions that are
out of our scope. Determine, based on the information available, what is most
likely to move the needle if solved.

- **Define the problem statement**

The problem statement should focus on the outcome instead of hinting at the
solution, (i.e., we won't be creating a website, but instead how to cater to the
needs of a specific audience through online presence).

### User Personas Workshop

Understanding the users of the solution and what they can and will do is a
critically important step of the design process. To appropriately implement the
solution, we must understand the user's prior knowledge, skills, needs, and
traits that are relevant to the solution. Based on this information, the persona
or multiple personas can be produced to bring a user-centered approach during
the process of designing the solution.

#### What is needed for this workshop

Previous user research, data sources like event logs, metrics and analytics,
user feedback are required to validate the personas.

- Existing user research
- Audience segmentation report
- Focus group studies
- Sales and CRM data
- Customer service data
- Website analytics
- Search Queries

##### What will happen during the workshop

- **Revealing the users through facilitated discussion**

Discussion and debate are critical activities in this process, and all opinions
must be represented. The goal of this session is to collect everyone's
assumptions, stories, and thoughts regarding the users. Write down everything
that is known about the users. User questions such as: Why are they interested
in the solution? What problem are they trying to solve? What previous experience
do they have in relation to the solution? What motivates them towards the
solution? What will make the solution appealing for them?

- **Affinity Mapping to identify clusters**

An affinity map is a method used to organize large amounts of data into groups
or themes based on identified connections and patterns. For this, we write down
all findings, observations, or ideas on sticky notes and look for concepts that
are related until clear groups emerge. These clusters are then named and ranked
by importance to decide which ones should be prioritized according to business
goals.

- **Gathering Evidence**

Personas are representations of the users, so the more detailed the level of
data used to shape them, the better. Post-validate the accuracy of the clusters
identified in the previous step against facts, analytics data, interviews, etc.

For areas where no data or evidence exists, we can consider doing additional
user research if necessary, employing methods such as surveys, focus groups,
contextual inquiry, etc.

- **Constructing and sharing the personas:**

Identify each cluster with a representative name, and add any missing details to
complete the persona, along with other attributes, such as their goals,
behaviors, and motivations.

It is important to present the personas to the entire team, along with
scenarios, to illustrate how they are used.

### User Journey Workshop

For an effective solution to be developed, we need to be able to determine the
content and the tasks that will make it up. The result of the User Journey
Workshop is a scope and sequence of the content and tasks that will make up the
solution. Typically, this will take the form of an outline or a visual
representation, such as a flowchart.

#### What is needed for this workshop

An overview of the existing screens or functionality should be provided for this
workshop. These can be presented in as roadmaps, wireframes, flowcharts,
funnels, or any other artifact that explicitly depicts the existing or potential
user journeys.

#### What will happen during the workshop

- **Task Inventory**

Identify the tasks relevant to the problem and describe them in detail.

- **Sequencing Tasks and Task Components**

Determine the order, content and sub-tasks that must occur in order to
succesfully complete a goal. Start with the major goals and work the way down to
sub-tasks that are associated with it. This can be done by sketching on a
whiteboard or by placing sticky notes to form a diagram.

- **Map all the tasks into a journey**

Compile all the goals, tasks and steps into a single map. If more than one
persona exists, then create a journey map for each.

### KPIs Workshop

**Defining metrics of success**

Establishing outcome metrics should be done before the project starts. If
metrics aren't set early in the process, we end up looking for data that fits
the result in a later stage, when modifications are no longer possible or
expensive. Instead, we could have used them during the project to generate
optimal results and adjust accordingly.

This step could be its own workshop as we'd need them to describe what their
success factors are so that the solution will be aligned with them. By doing
this, it will be easier to prioritize work on future iterations based on metric
performance.

(This also helps simplabs to better communicate the impact of our work for
future case studies)

**Example of KPIs**

- Task success rate
- Time-on-task
- User error rate
- System usability scale
- Customer Satisfaction scale
- Churn Rate

**What will happen during this workshop?**

- **Goals and objectives are defined**

What do we aim to change? E.g., turn existing users into customers.

- **Critical success factors are identified**

What are the expected effects of that change? How much should they change so
that we observe an effect?

E.g., 15% more users subscribe to a premium plan during their first 3 months

- **Rationale, historical data, analytics**

Why do we think those changes will happen? What evidence do we have for that?

- **How will the measures be collected**

How can we measure the effect? What are the leading indicators that we need to
track?

### Ideation Activities

### Define scope or starting point

Based on the previous activities, we decide on a starting point and scope for
the ideation. It might be useful to check for existing solutions or similar
problems. Not everything needs to be solved at once, so we'll probably want to
split the ideation into multiple manageable parts.

### Prototyping

We create prototypes to represent each use case or sometimes several use cases
to form a representation of the complete solution. This is where all is combined
into a prototype of the solution. This will become the basis for planning and
implementation. While not all the prototypes will be implemented, they will
serve as a collection of all the learning and insights acquired during the
conceptual design phase.

### Brand and Visual Language Session

The client gives us an introduction to their brand, existing brand material, and
visual guidelines. Based on this, we might or might not need to develop a new
visual language, but instead find opportunities to improve the existing one.

We need to understand where the existing visual language exists and the risks
and costs associated with changes.

### Assessing the effectiveness of the visual language

If required, we can arrange activities to gain more insights into the visual
language.

#### Brand Perception Surveys

We can uncover conflicts that exist between brand perception and identified the
user or business needs. If for example, we have revealed that a lack of trust is
blocking users from signing up, we might consider the brand elements effect on
the user experience.

#### Visual Design Evaluation (usability, accessibility)

In the case where the solution is an improvement to an existing app or website, we must ensure that the current visual design complies with our functional requirements and design specifications.
A detailed evaluation of the existing visual style will be conducted to identify possible issues that might impact the quality of the solution. A quality solution should consist of a visual style that is intuitive, easy to understand by anyone, and consistent throughout the entire design.

Based on the result of the evaluation the following are possible:

- **The client doesn't need a complete visual redesign, but instead, we need to
  adapt the design system components to fit his visual language.**
- **The client needs a redesign that will solve the problems identified during
  the evaluation.**

### Design of Visual Language

The visual language should provide standards for the solution's visual look and
feel based on the visual exploration conducted on the previous step. Fonts,
color schemes, layout specifications should all be part of the visual language
design.
