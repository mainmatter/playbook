# Conception Workflow

When drafting concepts for effective software solutions, we work closely with
our clients to ensure we are building an application that provides the right
features for the right users in the right way. Our clients have unique expertise
around their business, market and users and we help them translate that into a
concrete concept for an application.

While applying a systematic approach for developing a good understanding of what
will be built, we intentionally keep the conception phase limited and don't do
excessively detailed up-front design. Detailed wireframes tend to give a false
impression of completeness while it is actually almost impossible to prevent new
challenges and edge cases for particular features to only be uncovered while
implementing the feature. Also, static wireframes or even interactive prototypes
will never give the user as realistic an impression as they will get from an
actual application, even if that does not contain all of the features initially
but is only built up incrementally over time. Therefore, we aim for a quick
transition to the execution stage in which we turn the concept into a usable
application which we then extend in short iteration cycles. A real application
that can be interacted with serves as a much better foundation for all
subsequent discussions among the project stakeholders than any static concept
could do.

## User Stories Workshop

In the User Stories workshop, we will define concrete ways to achieve the
project's objectives as defined in the
[discovery workshop](../../project-flow/full-service/#discovery). The goal is to
develop an understanding of what the structure of the application's content and
functionality is, what the UI elements are that the users interact with and what
the transitions between individual states of a feature flow are.

This workshop requires input from all project stakeholders:

- the client has unique business expertise and understands best what a goal a
  particular user story aims to enable the user to achieve
- designers have the expertise to understand what interaction design lets the
  user achieve the above goal in the most efficient way
- engineers can assess different alternatives for their technical feasibility
  and necessary effort

If the application is going to replace an existing system, the functionality
provided by that system can be used as a reference for identifying the user
stories to be built.

### Activities

Each self-contained piece of functionality that the application provides is
converted into a user story. Some of those might also appear in more than one
user journey.

For each of these user stories, we identify:

- the navigational structure: screens or pages, dialogs, menus etc.
- interactive elements: buttons, inputs etc. that the user needs to trigger
  actions and events in the flow
- flows: transitions between portions of the navigational structure that are
  triggered by interactive elements

We will represent these user stories in low-fidelity flow diagrams that describe
how the elements

### Outcome

## Prototyping

Once we have defined what we are building and who we build it for, we need to
define how the application should eventually look and behave visually. In order
to achieve that, we create a high-fidelity prototype for one of the user stories
to develop a mutual understanding for the look and feel of the application.
Depending on the characteristics of the application, the prototype can be a
static mockup or an interactive click-dummy. If we can, we will validate the
prototype with future users or representatives of the target audience.

We only prepare the prototype for the first increment of the application, for
the user story that will be built first in the execution stage. For subsequent
increments the prototyping stage is not necessary and we'll go straight to the
execution stage building on the
[visual design system](../execution/design/#design-systems) established in
previous increments.

The visual direction of the project will be based on the client's branding and
visual guidelines if such materials exist or be developed from scratch. In the
latter case, we will apply techniques like moodboards and stylescapes to find a
visual direction that all stakeholders agree on.
