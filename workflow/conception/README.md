# Conception Workflow

When drafting concepts for effective software solutions, we work closely with
our clients in a series of workshops to ensure we are building an application
that solves the right problem in the right way. Our clients have unique
expertise around their business, market and users and we help them translate
those into a concrete application concept.

While applying a systematic approach to develop a good understanding of what
will be built, we intentionally keep the conception phase limited and don't do
excessively detailed up-front design. Instead, we aim for a quick transition to
the execution stage in which we turn the concept into a usable application which
serves as a much better foundation for all subsequent discussions among the
project stakeholders than any concept could do.

## Personas Workshop

Understanding who the future users of the application will be is a critically
important step for developing a good concept. Their prior knowledge, skills,
needs, and motivations will affect all aspects of the application. By defining
one or more key personas representing typical users of the application, we can
base all subsequent conceptional work on those in a user-centered approach.

Identifying and describing the personas should not be done based on assumptions
but instead leverage previous research, data gathered from analytics or other
systems like CRM or customer service systems or feedback received from users
directly. If no such data exists, we can help clients to conduct the necessary
research or set up tracking in existing systems in order not to go ahead while
lacking the necessary foundation and potentially going in the wrong direction.

### Activities

It is important for all project stakeholders to be involved in this meeting as
everyone will have unique insights, experiences and expectations regarding
existing as well as prospective customers and users. All of these thoughts must
be represented so no crucial information is missed. The participants identify
typical users in an open discussion, asking questions like:

- why are they interested in the in the solution?
- what problem do they have that we are trying to solve?
- what previous experience do they have in relation to the solution?
- what motivates them?
- what will make the solution appealing for them?

After having identified these typical users, they are grouped based on common
characteristics. Using information gathered during previous research, the groups
are validated against known facts, analytics data, interviews, etc. Once
validated, the groups are named and ranked by importance to support a decision
on which groups should be prioritized according to business goals. If a group
fails to be validated, it needs to either be removed from the list of personas
or be modified or potentially split up into several smaller groups.

For each persona we prepare a one page overview with a description of their
attributes, goals, behaviors, and motivations as well as some typical scenarios
in which they would use the application.

## User Journeys Workshop

Each persona identified in the personas workshop is going to use the application
for a particular reason and with a particular goal. In the User Journeys
workshop we identify the journeys the users take through the application and the
individual tasks that make those up.

The goal is not to draw high-fidelity mockups of fully designed screens but
develop an understanding of what the individual tasks and actions are per
journey, what the UI elements are that the users interact with and what the
potential transitions between individual states of each journey are. This will
lead to a number of individual features that constitute the functionality that
the application provides and different personas will use on their user journeys.

If the application is going to replace an existing system, screens and
functionality in that system can be used as a reference for identifying the user
journeys to be built.

### Activities

For each user journey, we will identify the atomic tasks that it is made up from
and add the transitions that can occur between them. Once these are identified,
we try to simplify the process by combining tasks or remove individual steps in
an effort to simplify the feature. Lastly, for each task we identify the UI
elements that are necessary for the user to trigger the actions and get the
information they need to drive the flow.

Once the user journeys have been identified and described, we break them down
into feature descriptions. Features are the building blocks of one or more user
journeys and are self-contained flows through the application. For each of these
features, we draw a diagram including the involved UI elements, tasks, states
and transitions along with a description of the feature.

For each of the features, we will identify these For an effective solution to be
developed, we need to be able to determine the content and the tasks that will
make it up. The result of the User Journey Workshop is a scope and sequence of
the content and tasks that will make up the solution. Typically, this will take
the form of an outline or a visual representation, such as a flowchart.

## Brand and Visual Language Session

The client gives us an introduction to their brand, existing brand material, and
visual guidelines. Based on this, we might or might not need to develop a new
visual language, but instead find opportunities to improve the existing one.

We need to understand where the existing visual language exists and the risks
and costs associated with changes.

### Assessing the effectiveness of the Visual Design System

If the visual design of the existing solution is not built on a solid
foundation, we might find that technical and design debt is generated as we
implement the new solution, causing the project to slow down. We want to avoid
shipping one-off visual design solutions, but instead agree on a path forward
with the client before executing any design.

#### Visual Design System dependencies

Based on the complexity and extent of a project, we might encounter that the
existing visual design system is dependent on complementary systems such as
branding or identity. In this case, the client needs to provide the guidelines
and rules in the form of documentation that can be applied clearly.

#### Visual Identity Evaluation

We can uncover conflicts that exist between the visual identity and user or
business needs. If for example, we have revealed that a lack of trust is
blocking users from signing up, we might consider the brand elements effect on
the user experience.

#### Visual Design System Evaluation (usability, accessibility)

In the case where the solution is an improvement to an existing app or website,
we must ensure that the current visual design complies with our functional
requirements and design specifications. A detailed evaluation of the existing
visual style will be conducted to identify possible issues that might impact the
quality of the solution. A quality solution should consist of a visual style
that is intuitive, easy to understand by anyone, and consistent throughout the
entire design.

Based on the result of the evaluation the following are possible:

- **The client doesn't need a complete visual redesign, but instead, we need to
  adapt the design system components to fit his visual language.**
- **The client needs a redesign that will solve the problems identified during
  the evaluation.**

## Prototyping

We create prototypes to represent each use case or sometimes several use cases
to form a representation of the complete solution. This is where all is combined
into a prototype of the solution. This will become the basis for planning and
implementation. While not all the prototypes will be implemented, they will
serve as a collection of all the learning and insights acquired during the
conceptual design phase.
