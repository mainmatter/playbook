# Conception Workflow

When drafting concepts for effective software solutions, we work closely with
our clients in a series of workshops to ensure we are building an application
that solves the right problems in the right way. Our clients have unique
expertise around their business, market and users and we help them translate
that into a concrete concept for an application.

While applying a systematic approach to develop a good understanding of what
will be built, we intentionally keep the conception phase limited and don't do
excessively detailed up-front design. Instead, we aim for a quick transition to
the execution stage in which we turn the concept into a usable application which
we then extend in short iteration cycles. A real application that can be
interacted with serves as a much better foundation for all subsequent
discussions among the project stakeholders than any static concept could do.

## User Stories Workshop

Each persona identified in the personas workshop is going to use the application
for a particular reason and with a particular goal. In the User Stories workshop
we identify the journeys the users take through the application and the
individual user stories that make those up.

The goal is to develop an understanding of what the structure of the
application's content and functionality is, what the UI elements are that the
users interact with and what the transitions between individual states of a
feature flow are. This will lead to a number of user stories that constitute the
functionality that the application provides and different personas will use when
using the application.

If the application is going to replace an existing system, screens and
functionality in that system can be used as a reference for identifying the user
stories to be built.

### Activities

For each user persona, we will identify the typical journey that persona will
take through the application. For these journeys, we identify the atomic tasks
that it is made up of and add the transitions that can occur between them. Once
these are identified, we try to simplify the process by combining tasks or
remove individual steps in an effort to simplify the flow. Lastly, for each task
we identify the UI elements that are necessary for the user to trigger the
actions and get the information they need to drive the flow.

Once the user journeys have been identified and described, we break them down
into user stories. User stories are the building blocks of one or more user
journeys and are self-contained flows through the application that have a
concrete goal. For each of these user stories, we draw a diagram including the
involved UI elements, tasks, states and transitions between them. Along with a
textual description of the story and the description of the persona(s) that will
be using the user story, this becomes the user story definition.

## Prototyping

Once we have defined what we are building and who we build it for, we need to
define how the application should eventually look and behave visually. In order
to achieve that, we create a high-fidelity prototype for one of the user stories
to develop a mutual understanding for the look and feel of the application.
Depending on the characteristics of the application, the prototype can be a
static mockup or an interactive click-dummy. If we can, we will validate the
prototype with future users or representatives of the target audience.

We only prepare the prototype for the first increment of the application, for
the user story that will be built first in the execution stage. For subsequent
increments the prototyping stage is not necessary and we'll go straight to the
execution stage building on the
[visual design system](../execution/design/#design-systems) established in
previous increments.

The visual direction of the project will be based on the client's branding and
visual guidelines if such materials exist or be developed from scratch. In the
latter case, we will apply techniques like moodboards and stylescapes to find a
visual direction that all stakeholders agree on.
