# Conception Workflow

When drafting concepts for effective software solutions, we work closely with
our clients in a series of workshops to ensure we are building an application
that solves the right problem in the right way. Our clients have unique
expertise around their business, market and users and we help them translate
those into a concrete application concept.

While applying a systematic approach to develop a good understanding of what
will be built, we intentionally keep the conception phase limited and don't do
excessively detailed up-front design. Instead, we aim for a quick transition to
the execution stage in which we turn the concept into a usable application which
serves as a much better foundation for all subsequent discussions among the
project stakeholders than any concept could do.

## Personas Workshop

Understanding who the future users of the application will be is a critically
important step for developing a good concept. Their prior knowledge, skills,
needs, and motivations will affect all aspects of the application. By defining
one or more key personas representing typical users of the application, we can
base all subsequent conceptional work on those in a user-centered approach.

Identifying and describing the personas should not be done based on assumptions
but instead leverage previous research, data gathered from analytics or other
systems like CRM or customer service systems or feedback received from users
directly. If no such data exists, we can help clients to conduct the necessary
research or set up tracking in existing systems in order not to go ahead while
lacking the necessary foundation and potentially going in the wrong direction.

### Activities

It is important for all project stakeholders to be involved in this meeting as
everyone will have unique insights, experiences and expectations regarding
existing as well as prospective customers and users. All of these thoughts must
be represented so no crucial information is missed. The participants identify
typical users in an open discussion, asking questions like:

- why are they interested in the in the solution?
- what problem do they have that we are trying to solve?
- what previous experience do they have in relation to the solution?
- what motivates them?
- what will make the solution appealing for them?

After having identified these typical users, they are grouped based on common
characteristics. Using information gathered during previous research, the groups
are validated against known facts, analytics data, interviews, etc. Once
validated, the groups are named and ranked by importance to support a decision
on which groups should be prioritized according to business goals. If a group
fails to be validated, it needs to either be removed from the list of personas
or be modified or potentially split up into several smaller groups.

For each persona we prepare a one page overview with a description of their
attributes, goals, behaviors, and motivations as well as some typical scenarios
in which they would use the application.

## User Journeys Workshop

Each persona identified in the personas workshop is going to use the application
for a particular reason and with a particular goal. In the User Journeys
workshop we identify the journeys the users take through the application and the
individual tasks that make those up.

The goal is not to draw high-fidelity mockups of fully designed screens but
develop an understanding of what the individual tasks and actions are per
journey, what the UI elements are that the users interact with and what the
potential transitions between individual states of each journey are. This will
lead to a number of individual features that constitute the functionality that
the application provides and different personas will use on their user journeys.

If the application is going to replace an existing system, screens and
functionality in that system can be used as a reference for identifying the user
journeys to be built.

### Activities

For each user journey, we will identify the atomic tasks that it is made up from
and add the transitions that can occur between them. Once these are identified,
we try to simplify the process by combining tasks or remove individual steps in
an effort to simplify the feature. Lastly, for each task we identify the UI
elements that are necessary for the user to trigger the actions and get the
information they need to drive the flow.

Once the user journeys have been identified and described, we break them down
into feature descriptions. Features are the building blocks of one or more user
journeys and are self-contained flows through the application. For each of these
features, we draw a diagram including the involved UI elements, tasks, states
and transitions along with a description of the feature.

For each of the features, we will identify these For an effective solution to be
developed, we need to be able to determine the content and the tasks that will
make it up. The result of the User Journey Workshop is a scope and sequence of
the content and tasks that will make up the solution. Typically, this will take
the form of an outline or a visual representation, such as a flowchart.

## Prototyping

Once we have defined what we are building and who we build for, we need to
define how the application should eventually look and behave. In order to
achieve that, we create a high-fidelity prototype for one of the defined
features to develop a mutual understanding for the look and feel of the
application. Depending on the characteristics of the application, the prototypes
can be static mockups or interactive click-dummies. If we can, we will validate
the prototypes with actual future users or representatives of the target
audience.

We deliberately limit ourselves to only prototyping one feature in an effort to
not invest too much time and effort in up-front planning and specification as we
aim to advance to the execution stage fast and run iterations based on the
actual application instead.

### Brand and Visual Language Session

When building the first increment of an application, we need to develop and
agree on a visual language with the client. That will be based on the client's
branding and visual guidelines if such materials exist or be developed from
scratch. In the latter case, we will apply techniques like moodboards and
stylescapes to find a visual direction that all stakeholders agree on.

The prototype(s) build the foundation for the
[design system](../execution/design/#design-systems) that we incrementally
develop during the execution stage of the project.
