# Conception Workflow

When drafting concepts for effective software solutions, we work closely with
our clients in a series of workshops to ensure we are building an application
that solves the right problem in the right way. Our clients have unique
expertise around their business, market and users and we help them translate
those into a concrete application concept.

While applying a systematic approach to develop a good understanding of what
will be built, we intentionally keep the conception phase limited and don't do
excessively detailed up-front design. Instead, we aim for a quick transition to
the execution stage in which we turn the concept into a usable application which
serves as a much better foundation for all subsequent discussions among the
project stakeholders than any concept could do.

## Personas Workshop

Understanding who the future users of the application will be is a critically
important step for developing a good concept. Their prior knowledge, skills,
needs, and motivations will affect all aspects of the application. By defining
one or more key personas representing typical users of the application, we can
base all subsequent conceptional work on those in a user-centered approach.

Identifying and describing the personas should not be done based on assumptions
but instead leverage previous research, data gathered from analytics or other
systems like CRM or customer service systems or feedback received from users
directly. If no such data exists, we can help clients to conduct the necessary
research or set up tracking in existing systems in order not to go ahead while
lacking the necessary foundation and potentially going in the wrong direction.

### Activities

It is important for all project stakeholders to be involved in this meeting as
everyone will have unique insights, experiences and expectations regarding
existing as well as prospective customers and users. All of these thoughts must
be represented so no crucial information is missed. The participants identify
typical users in an open discussion, asking questions like:

- why are they interested in the in the solution?
- what problem do they have that we are trying to solve?
- what previous experience do they have in relation to the solution?
- what motivates them?
- what will make the solution appealing for them?

After having identified these typical users, they are grouped based on common
characteristics. Using information gathered during previous research, the groups
are validated against known facts, analytics data, interviews, etc. Once
validated, the groups are named and ranked by importance to support a decision
on which groups should be prioritized according to business goals. If a group
fails to be validated, it needs to either be removed from the list of personas
or be modified or potentially split up into several smaller groups.

For each persona we prepare a one page overview with a description of their
attributes, goals, behaviors, and motivations as well as some typical scenarios
in which they would use the application.

## User Stories Workshop

Each persona identified in the personas workshop is going to use the application
for a particular reason and with a particular goal. In the User Stories workshop
we identify the journeys the users take through the application and the
individual user stories that make those up.

The goal is not to draw high-fidelity mockups of fully designed screens but
develop an understanding of what the structure of the application's content and
functionality is, what the UI elements are that the users interact with and what
the transitions between individual states of a feature flow are. This will lead
to a number of individual user stories that constitute the functionality that
the application provides and different personas will use on their user journeys.

If the application is going to replace an existing system, screens and
functionality in that system can be used as a reference for identifying the user
stories to be built.

### Activities

For each user persona, we will identify the typical journey that persona will
take through the application. For the journeys, we will identify the atomic
tasks that it is made up of and add the transitions that can occur between them.
Once these are identified, we try to simplify the process by combining tasks or
remove individual steps in an effort to simplify the flow. Lastly, for each task
we identify the UI elements that are necessary for the user to trigger the
actions and get the information they need to drive the flow.

Once the user journeys have been identified and described, we break them down
into user stories. User stories are the building blocks of one or more user
journeys and are self-contained flows through the application. For each of these
user stories, we draw a diagram including the involved UI elements, tasks,
states and transitions along with a description of the story.

## Prototyping

Once we have defined what we are building and who we build for, we need to
define how the application should eventually look and behave. In order to
achieve that, we create a high-fidelity prototype for one of the defined user
stories to develop a mutual understanding for the look and feel of the
application. Depending on the characteristics of the application, the prototype
can be a static mockup or an interactive click-dummy. If we can, we will
validate the prototype with future users or representatives of the target
audience.

We only prepare the prototype for the first increment of the application, for
the user story that will be built first in the execution stage to set the visual
direction for the project. For subsequent increments the prototyping stage is
not necessary and we'll go straight to the execution stage building on the
[visual design system](../execution/design/#design-systems) established in
previous increments.

### Brand and Visual Language Session

When building the first increment of an application, we also need to develop and
agree on a visual language with the client. That will be based on the client's
branding and visual guidelines if such materials exist or be developed from
scratch. In the latter case, we will apply techniques like moodboards and
stylescapes to find a visual direction that all stakeholders agree on.

The prototype(s) build the foundation for the
[design system](../execution/design/#design-systems) that we incrementally
develop during the execution stage of the project.
