# Engineering Workflow

Our engineering workflow is based on established practices from the open source
community. It supports communication and sharing know-how among teams.

## Feature Branches/Pull Requests

All changes to a project are done in branches. No changes should ever be
committed to the `master` branch (or whatever the project's main branch is)
directly. There should generally be at least one branch per issue - for larger
issues it often makes sense to split separate steps into separate branches and
merge them one after another.

All changes in a branch should also be related to the same _"topic"_ - e.g one
branch should not address more than one issue or change entirely unrelated
aspects of the application.

If the testing setup, hosting environment and potentially other requirements
present for the delivered product allow it, we recommend setting up continuous
deployment so changes get deployed to production as the respective pull request
gets merged. If that is not possible, we recommend setting up continuous
deployment for a staging system at least so all project stakeholders can follow
the project's progress.

### Commits

Just as all changes in a branch should be related to the same _"topic"_, all
changes within a single commit should be related to the same step in
implementing that topic. Each commit should only do one _"thing"_, ideally not
touching on too many different parts of the code base. All commits should also
have good [commit messages](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_discussion)
that make clear what the particular commit does.

### Pull Requests

Branches are not merged back to the `master` branch directly but via pull
requests (or whatever mechanism the tool used in the particular project
provides). The pull request should have a meaningful description with a rough
overview of the changes included in it and the issue it refers to. If the pull
request closes an issue, the pull request's description should contain a comment
like _"closes #<issue>"_ - most tools will then automatically close the
referenced issue once the pull request is merged.

As with issues, all discussions around a particular pull request should happen
on the pull request's page. If discussions happen in person or over online chat,
a summary should be posted to the pull request so all information and context is
accessible to everyone interested at any time.

It is perfectly fine to create pull requests early on while implementation is
still ongoing and they are not yet ready to be reviewed or merged. Doing so is a
good way to get early feedback and share the status of something with the rest
of the team. Such pull requests should be marked as _"Work in progress"_ though,
usually by prefixing their title with `WIP:`. Some tools will even block _"Work
in progress"_ pull requests from being merged.

### Reviews

Pull requests are reviewed before they get merged back into the project's main
branch; pull requests that have not been reviewed should usually not get merged.
In order for a pull request to be ready for review, though, it has to meet some
pre-requisites:

- the branch has no conflicts with the project's main branch
- the changes in the branch are covered by proper tests and CI is passing
- the branch is not marked as _"work in progress"_
- the commit history of the pull request has been cleaned up, e.g. WIP commits
  have been squashed, debug commits have been removed etc.

When a pull request is ready for review, its author should actively ask for
another team member to review - ideally via the tools used in the particular
project if those support it or over online chat etc. if not. Everyone asked for
review should reply in a timely manner - even if it's to ask for someone else to
be chosen if they do not have the time to do a proper review.

Once the reviewer approved the changes and CI passes, the pull request can be
merged by any team member including the pull request's author. If the original
reviewer would like a second review by another team member, potentially one more
familiar with the aspects of the application that are changed by the particular
pull request, they will ask for it. In case anything comes up in the review that
cannot be resolved between the reviewer and the author of the pull request, a
third person should be brought in to resolve the deadlock.

#### Review Guidelines

Reviewing and potentially criticizing other people's work is a sensitive issue
which is why we follow a set of rules when doing so:

- be polite: you are reviewing another person's work that they put time and
  energy in - don't be dismissive and keep a friendly tone
- be clear: don't be ambiguous but clearly address issues or aspects that are
  good about a particular change
- be positive: while the review's main purpose is to identify mistakes or bad
  patterns that are not caught by CI, reviews are also a good opportunity to
  give feedback on changes that are particularly good
- be helpful: if a pull request contains a particular change you don't think
  should be merged, give the author some guidance by introducing an alternative
  to the change that does not come with the same drawbacks

## Testing

Testing is an integral part of our work and a necessity for delivering high
quality results that also do not deteriorate over time. We generally do not
merge untested changes and would usually not even review them as we cannot know
whether the code under review actually works for all relevant scenarios.

While different languages and frameworks provide different testing mechanisms, a
good approach generally is

- leveraging small and isolated test cases (e.g. unit tests) for the majority of
  the test cases including edge cases
- leveraging higher level test cases (e.g. integration or acceptance tests) for
  ensuring the main features and flows of an application work as expected

We require continuous integration to be set up in all projects we work on. While
it should always be possible to run tests locally, they also need to run
automatically for every pull requests and after each merge to the project's main
branch.

## Refactoring

Refactoring is an essential part of any software project. As requirements change
and frameworks and languages progress, code written in the past will eventually
not be ideal anymore in the present and future. Constant refactoring ensures the
code base does not become stale and improves productivity overall by keeping
technical debt at a minimum and avoiding big, painful and risky rewrites that
otherwise often become necessary down the line.

When working on the code base, we will keep an eye open for parts that need to
be refactored and either do so immediately in case of simple changes, or bring
them up as individual issues for one of the next [iterations](../../process).

## Pairing

Pairing is a great way of spreading knowledge throughout the team, on-boarding
new team members or resolving blockers. We encourage everyone to pair and will
also pair with our clients' internal engineers to help them level up their
experience.
