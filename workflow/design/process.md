# Design Process

## Combining technical expertise with user experience

As technology experts, we know that the success of a project lies not only in having a good process but also in giving proper attention when considering the technical aspects of the solution, we do so by putting the user front and center.

Technological choices should be determined by the user needs and expectations while still supporting the business goals of our clients.

Example:
A native app might be great for a user need that requires complex interface interactions (e.g., photo and video editors, games). However, a web app would better serve an e-commerce experience, mobile wallet apps, or location-based apps (link to breethe). 

## Our Design Process

At simplabs, we aim to deliver innovative design solutions for our clients. We do this by listening to what our clients want and help them reframe their problems into actions. By involving them in the design early and throughout the process. By thinking through the factors that produce an optimal user experience.

All of this is possible, thanks to our design process. At the core of this process is the user, and all steps are based on a collaborative and iterative approach, from requirements gathering and persona research to behaviors and scenarios and interactions.

Our process is ideal for complex projects because it breaks problems into manageable parts from the start.

Because we apply an iterative approach, we can prevent most common project pitfalls, such as running out of budget, time, or even failing to solve the problem altogether.

### First contact with the client - Setting a solid foundation

When a client approaches us with an initial requirement, we reach out to them to find out more about their problem. Understanding our client's business and openly discussing our design process is fundamental for establishing a good relationship from the get-go.

For that reason, we have made our design playbook available here: [link]. Our playbook provides an overview of the methods we use to gather and interpret requirements to design solutions that transform our client's ideas into successful digital products.

## How we apply the Design Process

**Understand, Align, Execute & Iterate**

Our process is a series of steps we go through, to deliver optimal design solutions consistently. The process also supports the alignment with our clients across the entire project.

Each step is applied to the project as a whole and for each individual feature.

## Understand - Discovery and Definition
(brand, users, goals)

Our design process begins with a phase of information gathering and research, aimed at providing us with insights into all aspects of the design problem. This helps us define the scope and requirements of the project.
In cases where the design problem is not apparent, we can improve our clients to develop their problem statement.

By employing the best of our research and strategy skills (design thinking, design sprints), we involve our clients early in the process through thoughtfully planned workshops; the outcome is a reframed problem statement. 

Learn more about our discovery workshops (here).

### Personas Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to establish consensus around the 'who' and the 'why' for a design project. The personas built on this step will provide a valuable tool for design collaboration and prioritization of features.

#### Who should attend this workshop

#### The user experts
A user expert will be whoever is closer to the customers and can provide information and data regarding their goals, pain points, and behavior patterns.
It is desirable to analyze different points of view at this stage, whether it is from a sales representative, customer support specialist, or a domain expert. This confluence of ideas will allow data from many sources to shape more robust personas.

#### What will happen during the workshop

#### Finding the Users: Facilitated Discussion
Discussion and debate are critical activities in this process and it's essential that all opinions are represented. The goal of this session is to collect everyone's assumptions and thoughts regarding the users, who they are and recall their experiences with them.

#### Verification: Evidence-based personas
At this point, we want to connect the assumptions to actual evidence, research data, or documents that reinforce the assumptions listed during the discussion.
For areas where no data or evidence exists, we can consider doing additional user research if necessary, employing methods such as surveys, focus groups, contextual inquiry.

#### Finding patterns: Affinity Mapping
An affinity map is a method used to organize large amounts of data into groups or themes based on identified connections and patterns. For this, we write down all findings, observations or ideas on sticky notes and look for concepts that are related until clear groups emerge. These clusters are then named and ranked by importance to decide which ones should be prioritized according to business goals.

#### Constructing Personas:
(Turn clusters into personas)
Description of the categories identified in the previous step.

### User Journey Mapping Workshop

This workshop helps to understand how users are accessing the products and services over time and across different touch points and provides insight into areas for improvement. It is a practical way to improve existing products and innovate new ones. 

### Design Sprints Workshop

This workshop helps to set the right priorities and features for a product. Design sprints can help to either new or existing products. It can serve to improve the products they offer and to develop whole new value propositions. 

### Results of these workshops

At the end of this stage, we have an updated brief, that contains the problem statement, a prioritized list of user needs and goals, the personas that we are designing for and the user flows.

## Align - Design and Development

The definition phase is where we analyze the findings and the initial development of project ideas and components needed to solve the problem at hand. This is where findings from the Discovery phase are analyzed, defined, and refined as problems, and ideas for solutions are pitched and prototyped.

At the core of this phase is the collaboration between the design team and the project stakeholders. What matters most at this point is to try a large number of ideas or directions – whether it is by wireframing, prototyping, or even plain text.

This experimentation often results in new insights and conceptual breakthroughs that can be implemented into the final solution.

#### Setting up the stage for collaboration.

One of the benefits of bringing together people is the potential of many more ideas generated. This is a valuable way to make the process accessible to our clients and to help them understand how we approach their user's needs.

#### Workflow management / Design Iterations and Feedback

Explain how we capture design iterations and feedback and how this speeds up the process.

#### Reviews

Explain what we expect from a client review, in terms of scope and type of input.

#### Results

Leaving this phase we should have a set of documents blessed by the client which describe the project in all its details. This will include personas, user journeys, requirements documents and wireframes. 

While the next step happens, the development team can already begin implementation.


### Execute & Iterate

After we have collected all details, the design creation process can begin. We select parts from the outside in, starting with basic building blocks and ending with the smallest details. Every part will be drawn in design tools for reference and are meant to be reviewed by the team and stakeholders on the client's side. After each review and as necessary, the final artworks will be iterated on until they meet all requirements and expectations. 

#### Results

Result of the execution and continuous delivery to the development team are assets and final artworks for individual parts that can be applied to the project.
