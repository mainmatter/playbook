## Implementing visual design

We create visual mockups of the currently regarded aspect of the project.

For the project itself this means creating a visual design guide that executes
the foundation of the design work layout out in the concept phase, defining
colors, typographic rules and basic layout.

For indivdual features we only create mockups for the aspects of a feature that
deviate from the general guide or need more detailed definition, such as
individual UI states.

We use name design files in meaningful way and rely on some form of
versioning and a branching model to organize and structure our work.
