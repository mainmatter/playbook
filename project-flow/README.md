# Project Flow

We work on projects in a systematic manner with the goal to minimize overhead
and to be productive as soon as possible while making sure all stakeholders are
involved and all relevant information and context is shared among all of them.

## Kick-Off Meeting

Every project we do starts with a kick-off meeting that brings all of the
project stakeholders together - ideally in one room or if that is not possible,
in a video call. The main goal for this meeting is everyone involved getting to
know each other and understanding everyone else's roles, responsibilities and
goals. The group of project stakeholders should be kept as wide and open as
possible and also include people that won't necessarily be involved in the
project on a daily basis but still have relevant perspectives that our team and
everyone else should be aware of.

## Introduction

Following the kick-off meeting with all stakeholders, we also ask our clients to
give us an introduction to their business, explaining the problems they are
solving and why that is valuable for their customers, what differentiates them
from their competition etc. That will typically be done by one of the client's
business experts sitting together with our team and walking them through the key
aspects of the business. While this knowledge may not be directly relevant to
the work we're doing, it's essential for us to understand the environment our
clients are operating in as that helps us make better decisions and put
appropriate weight on individual aspects during the project.
