# Project Flow

Successful projects follow a well-defined procedure that clearly prescribes
which steps need to happen in which order and involves all stakeholders. The
relevant information for each step and the respective outcomes need to be
available for everyone at all times.

## Kick-Off Meeting

Every project should start with a kick-off meeting that brings all of the
project stakeholders together - ideally in one room or if that is not possible,
in a video call. The main goal for this meeting is everyone involved getting to
know each other and understanding everyone else's roles, responsibilities and
goals. The group of project stakeholders should be kept as wide and open as
possible and also include people that won't necessarily be involved in the
project on a daily basis but still have relevant perspectives that the project
team should be aware of.
