# Full Service Project Flow

## Full Service

In Full-Service projects, we guide the client through the entire project,
transforming their business problems through all-encompassing software
solutions.

One of the main goals here is to strike a balance between the fact that we
cannot commit to a deadline for a big project, the client needing to get
something that solves their problem, the client having no idea about software
and the client not knowing what they need.

We can split this into 4 phases - Conceptual Design, Plan, Implementation,
post-launch. We will go through the individual stages a few times per project -
the first time, we build the MVP version of the project, which has the smallest
possible feature set while still delivering value. Each subsequent time we go
through these phases, we try and identify a set of features that are coherent
and make a substantial improvement to the previous version of the project. These
incremental releases until we reach the final product map to high-level
milestones and help to break down the project into smaller chunks where each one
provides value. Ideally, each of these steps results in something releasable to
production so it could even be tested with real users, but that's not a
necessity for the process.

### Conceptual Design

The goal of the conceptual design phase is to understand what the problem is,
what a fitting solution is, and how much we need to do to deliver value. The
conceptual design phase comprises both definition and ideation activities. It
might be the case that after implementation, only the ideation phase is needed.
It is possible to only have an ideation loop to generate new ideas and skip
definition.

The conceptual design phase of the second pass of the project must overlap with
the implementation phase of the previous pass, so we don't end up in a situation
where implementation of phase x is completed but the conceptual design phase of
pass x+1 is not far enough for implementation for that pass to begin already,
and a few team members end up being blocked.

### Definition Activities

Before we can begin to create a solution for a client, we need to first
thoroughly analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

The **Discovery Workshop** describes the activities that help to answer the
questions: What is the problem? What type of solution is needed? How should the
solution help to solve the problem?

The **Personas Workshop** introduces the principles, processes, and practices of
User-Centered Design. Through the development of personas, the client and team
get to know and understand the people whose needs and goals the solution should
satisfy.

The **User Journey Workshop** introduces tasks analysis, which is a way of
understanding the content and tasks that will form the basis for the solution
being developed.

The **KPI's Workshop** defines success metrics for the solution, which helps
both the client and the team to align on goals and objectives and make better
decisions.

#### Who needs to participate on the workshops?

- **Project stakeholders**

They are the ones that need to agree on the design direction of the project.
This can include both business and engineering people.

- **The user experts**

They are the ones closer to the users and can provide information or data
regarding their goals, pain points, and behavior patterns. It is desirable to
integrate all different points of view at this stage, whether it is from a sales
representative, customer support specialist, or a subjet matter expert. If the
project's target audience is inside the client's company, we advise to bring in
people from the corresponding department.

### Discovery Workshop

The purpose of the design process is to produce a desired change. The change
could be many things, such as an improvement of user's attitudes towards a new
product or service, or an increase in visitor's engagement for a website.
Whatever prevents this change, and falls within our solution capabilities
(solved by software solutions), is going to be framed as the problem.

Therefore, an early step of our process is to identify the problem that needs to
be solved and the different variables surrounding this problem. The information
gathered during this workshop will help the team to be clear about what solution
needs to be developed.

As a result of this workshop, we should agree on the following:

- What the problem is
- Who is affected by the problem (e.g., end-users, support team, sales)
- How is the problem manifesting in the business (e.g., user feedback, low
  engagement, churn)
- What will the situation look like if the problem is solved or the solution is
  effective

#### What is needed for this workshop?

- Problem-specific information

Knowledge of the client's business and its context is needed to get at the
source of the problem. If specific information is required, the client needs to
provide it before the workshop. The designers will also gather information
through various means, such as interviews, observations, and reviews of existing
solutions.

- Pre-Workshop Client Goals Questionnaire

Understanding what change the client wants to achieve is essential for
determining the Discovery workshop activities. For that reason, we might request
that they fill out a questionnaire before we begin to structure the workshop.
Once we get the answers, we analyze them and use them to define an efficient
workshop agenda.

#### What happens during the workshop?

- **Facilitated discussion**

Discuss the information gathered previous to the meeting. Present all patterns
and insights uncovered during research to create a common understanding of the
problem context.

- **Goals Analysis**

Discuss the client's goals to determine how they are doing and how they should
be doing. If a gap exists, then we should determine the causes.

- **Set criteria for selecting a solution**

Not all gaps can be fixed at the same time, and some require solutions that are
out of our scope. Determine, based on the information available, what is most
likely to move the needle if solved.

- **Define the problem statement**

The problem statement should focus on the outcome instead of hinting at the
solution, (i.e., we won't be creating a website, but instead how to cater to the
needs of a specific audience through online presence).

### Personas Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to establish consensus around the 'who' and the
'why' for a design project. The personas built on this step will serve as a
valuable tool for design collaboration and prioritization of features.

#### What is needed for this workshop

Previous user research, data sources like event logs, metrics and analytics,
user feedback are required to validate the personas.

- Existing user research
- Audience segmentation report
- Focus group studies
- Sales and CRM data
- Customer service data
- Website analytics
- Search Queries

##### What will happen during the workshop

- **Revealing the users through facilitated discussion**

Discussion and debate are critical activities in this process, and all opinions
must be represented. The goal of this session is to collect everyone's
assumptions, stories, and thoughts regarding the users.

- **Affinity Mapping to identify clusters**

An affinity map is a method used to organize large amounts of data into groups
or themes based on identified connections and patterns. For this, we write down
all findings, observations, or ideas on sticky notes and look for concepts that
are related until clear groups emerge. These clusters are then named and ranked
by importance to decide which ones should be prioritized according to business
goals.

- **Gathering Evidence**

Personas are representations of the users, so the more detailed the level of
data used to shape them, the better. Post-validate the accuracy of the clusters
identified in the previous step against facts, analytics data, interviews, etc.

For areas where no data or evidence exists, we can consider doing additional
user research if necessary, employing methods such as surveys, focus groups,
contextual inquiry, etc.

- **Constructing and sharing the personas:**

Identify each cluster with a representative name, and add any missing details to
complete the persona, along with other attributes, such as their goals,
behaviors, and motivations.

It is important to present the personas to the entire team, along with
scenarios, to illustrate how they are used.

### User Journey Workshop

During this workshop, the user's tasks and steps are analyzed to understand how
they achieve their goals. In the case that goals aren't met, what opportunities
exist to improve this process.

#### What is needed for this workshop

An overview of the existing screens or functionality should be provided for this
workshop. These can be presented in as roadmaps, wireframes, flowcharts,
funnels, or any other artifact that explicitly depicts the existing or potential
user journeys.

#### What will happen during the workshop

- **Deconstructing the user journey: Task Analysis**

Task analysis is a way of examining the user journey steps and break them down
into sets of small tasks that users go through to complete goals. Once this step
is down, we can categorize the tasks by the type of effort required by the user,
whether it is decision-making, wayfinding, error or problem solving, etc.

- **Optimize the journey: Finding ways to remove or automate steps**

For each step, find out ways to eliminate unnecessary work for the user, _i.e.,_
re-entering data, looping through multiple screens that could be simplified into
one.

- **Plan what needs to be done in the form of functionality requirements,
  content strategy, or changes to the existing site or app structure.**

All the ideas should be written down, even if they won't be implemented in the
current iteration. Some suggestions might fall outside the scope of the project,
so they could be communicated to whoever is in charge.

- **Create prototypes to present the improved user journey.**

Mock-ups or quick prototypes should be created to visualize and communicate the
new, improved journey.

### KPIs Workshop

**Defining metrics of success**

Establishing outcome metrics should be done before the project starts. If
metrics aren't set early in the process, we end up looking for data that fits
the result in a later stage, when modifications are no longer possible or
expensive. Instead, we could have used them during the project to generate
optimal results and adjust accordingly.

This step could be its own workshop as we'd need them to describe what their
success factors are so that the solution will be aligned with them. By doing
this, it will be easier to prioritize work on future iterations based on metric
performance.

(This also helps simplabs to better communicate the impact of our work for
future case studies)

**Example of KPIs**

- Task success rate
- Time-on-task
- User error rate
- System usability scale
- Customer Satisfaction scale
- Churn Rate

**What will happen during this workshop?**

- **Goals and objectives are defined**

What do we aim to change? E.g., turn existing users into customers.

- **Critical success factors are identified**

What are the expected effects of that change? How much should they change so
that we observe an effect?

E.g., 15% more users subscribe to a premium plan during their first 3 months

- **Rationale, historical data, analytics**

Why do we think those changes will happen? What evidence do we have for that?

- **How will the measures be collected**

How can we measure the effect? What are the leading indicators that we need to
track?

### Ideation Activities

### Define scope or starting point

Based on the previous activities, we decide on a starting point and scope for
the ideation. It might be useful to check for existing solutions or similar
problems. Not everything needs to be solved at once, so we'll probably want to
split the ideation into multiple manageable parts.

### Prototyping

We create prototypes to represent each use case or sometimes several use cases
to form a representation of the complete solution. This is where all is combined
into a prototype of the solution. This will become the basis for planning and
implementation. While not all the prototypes will be implemented, they will
serve as a collection of all the learning and insights acquired during the
conceptual design phase.

### Brand and Visual Language Session

The client gives us an introduction to their brand, existing brand material, and
visual guidelines. Based on this, we might or might not need to develop a new
visual language, but instead find opportunities to improve the existing one.

We need to understand where the existing visual language exists and the risks
and costs associated with changes.

### Assessing the effectiveness of the visual language

If required, we can arrange activities to gain more insights into the visual
language.

#### Brand Perception Surveys

We can uncover conflicts that exist between brand perception and identified the
user or business needs. If for example, we have revealed that a lack of trust is
blocking users from signing up, we might consider the brand elements effect on
the user experience.

#### Visual Design Evaluation (usability, accessibility)

We can detect inconsistencies, problems with the fonts they are using (e.g.,
won't support some characters, hard to read), contrast is insufficient.

Based on the result of the evaluation the following are possible:

- **The client doesn't need a complete visual redesign, but instead, we need to
  adapt the design system components to fit his visual language.**
- **The client needs a redesign that will solve the problems identified during
  the evaluation.**

### Design of Visual Language

Describe the actual process here.

## Planning

Next we go to the planning phase; for the feature (set) defined and validated in
the user journeys step, we think about whether time or scope is fixed for
building this feature set (the only one can be fixed); if time is fixed, we try
and identify aspects of the feature that could be scoped down if we have to
later. We then try and give the customer an outlook for steps and overall
duration (this is an estimate, not a deadline).

The design and the list of documents that came out of the user journeys step are
the foundation for the implementation phase. Of course, they can change any
time, but it's what we start with. <We could give this a name, e.g., the
"bundle" or whatever>.

## Implementation

The implementation phase combines both executing the design and developing the
features in code. All of the work should be tracked on the same board, following
our iteration approach we're already using and that's described in other section
of this playbook.

In the first pass of the project, this could mean that engineering can only
start with a slight delay as the designers need to prepare enough wireframes, so
the engineers are not blocked. We do our normal iterations-based process and
planning, creating specific issues based on them that we bundled in the planning
step.

During implementation, we keep a staging system updated so all stakeholders can
follow along the process. We ask our clients to join the iteration meetings ().
We will build slices of the system at once, that is the design, backend, and
frontend code of something so we can release these three things together. This
way, we can be sure they work together and move on to the next slice (see 
[basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-10][integrating] for a good explanation).

## Post-launch

Post-launch we can operate the system for the client and potentially also
validate what we built works for users. Ideally, we'd be able to do this after
every pass of the full-service phase.

## Test and Validation

Let's include something about user interview or similar mechanisms  **after
release** - a validation step in which we ensure that what we built is actually
what users want.

**Testing with users**

Data analysis and survey methods can be used to determine a potential subset of
users that would be most representative for testing. In this way, we can gather
more valuable insights and feedback.

We would outline the right survey method to recruit potential test users,
qualify them, and design the experiments.
