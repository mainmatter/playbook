Kick-Off Phase
==============

This step is relevant for full-service projects as well as for our consulting offerings.

-   Everyone involved in the project from both sides meets so
-   Everyone knows who everyone else is, what everyone's goals etc. are
-   Someone from the client's team gives us a high-level intro to their business, so we know what context we operate in.

Consulting
==========

All of our consulting engagements have similar requirements in terms of the process that we need to follow

-   After the project kick-off, we need a deeper technical kick-off where the client's tech team introduces us to their codebase, explains pain points, etc.
-   After the technical introduction, we review their app within 2-3 days or so - they don't need to be involved the whole time but need to be available to answer questions.
-   We will discuss the findings document with them in the end.

Team Augmentation
-----------------

We can, after having done the review and thus having a good understanding of the client's situation, work with their team for the long term, sharing our know-how as we do so by e.g.

-   Pair programming
-   Reviewing pull requests and giving detailed feedback
-   Performing workshops and demos
-   Identifying and removing impediments
-   Identifying and fixing quality issues
-   Prototyping new things/spearheading research projects and spikes

Tutoring
--------

We can also tutor teams which is similar to Team augmentation, but we won't actually work with the team all the time but *only* focus on techniques to help them and maybe do regular interviews with them to get a better idea for their current situation and things they are struggling with, etc.

Full Project Delivery
---------------------

If we do full project delivery in a consulting arrangement that usually means the client has an internal product and design team. While this situation will be relatively similar to our full-service offering, we won't be driving the conceptual design phase in these cases most likely. I'm not sure we even want to mention this in our playbook in detail, but we should be aware that this exists as well.

Full Service
============

In Full-Service projects, we guide the client through the entire project, transforming their business problems/needs into software that solves these problems. One of the main goals here is to strike a balance between the fact that we cannot commit to a deadline for a big project, the client needing to get something that solves their problem, the client having no idea about software and the client not knowing what they need.

We can split this into 4 phases - Conceptual Design, Plan, Implementation, post-launch. We will go through the individual stages a few times per project - the first time, we build the MVP version of the project, which has the smallest possible feature set while still delivering value. Each subsequent time we go through these phases, we try and identify a set of features that are coherent and make a substantial improvement to the previous version of the project. These incremental releases until we reach the final product map to high-level milestones and help to break down the project into smaller chunks where each one provides value. Ideally, each of these steps results in something releasable to production so it could even be tested with real users, but that's not a necessity for the process.

Conceptual Design
-----------------

The goal of the conceptual design phase is to understand what the problem is, what a fitting solution is, and how much we need to do to add value.

The conceptual design phase of the second pass of the project must overlap with the implementation phase of the previous pass, so we don't end up in a situation where implementation of phase x is completed but the conceptual design phase of pass x+1 is not far enough for implementation for that pass to begin already, and a few team members end up being blocked.

Discovery Workshop
------------------

The purpose of the discovery workshop is to gain an understanding of the business problem or challenge. This not only helps to narrow the scope of the project, but it also links diverse points of view, business needs, and varying contexts into meaningful and actionable goals.

**What is needed for this workshop?**

-   Clients Questionnaires

To make the discovery session more efficient, we will provide handouts and questionnaires for the client. These questionnaires should be filled out and sent before the workshop so that the team can review and plan questioning paths with ***more*** refined and precise questions.

**Who should attend the workshop?**

-   Project Team
-   Client

**What happens during the workshop?**

-   **Define the problem statement**

The problem statement will be defined through a series of questions and facilitated discussion. The problem statement should focus on the outcome instead of hinting at the solution, (i.e., we won't be creating a website, but instead how to cater to the needs of a specific audience through online presence).

-   **Observe**

Once the problem has been identified, we need to gather more information to help us understand the broader context in which the challenge exists. Both quantitative or qualitative methods can be applied to this purpose.

-   **Point of View**

WRITE [This is the summary of the findings and who they are related to, and why they matter]

Personas Workshop
-----------------

The purpose of this workshop is to establish consensus around the 'who' and the 'why' for a design project. The personas built on this step will serve as a valuable tool for design collaboration and prioritization of features.

#### **Who should attend this workshop?**

-   **Project stakeholders**

They are the ones that need to agree on the design direction of the project. This can include both business and engineering people.

-   **The user experts**

They are the ones closer to the users and can provide information or data regarding their goals, pain points, and behavior patterns. It is desirable to integrate all different points of view at this stage, whether it is from a sales representative, customer support specialist, or a domain expert.

**What is needed for this workshop**

Previous user research, data sources like event logs, metrics and analytics, user feedback are required to validate the personas.

-   Existing user research
-   Audience segmentation report
-   Focus group studies
-   Sales and CRM data
-   Customer service data
-   Website analytics
-   Search Queries

#### What will happen during the workshop

-   **Revealing the users through facilitated discussion**

Discussion and debate are critical activities in this process, and all opinions must be represented. The goal of this session is to collect everyone's assumptions, stories, and thoughts regarding the users.

-   **Affinity Mapping to identify clusters**

An affinity map is a method used to organize large amounts of data into groups or themes based on identified connections and patterns. For this, we write down all findings, observations, or ideas on sticky notes and look for concepts that are related until clear groups emerge. These clusters are then named and ranked by importance to decide which ones should be prioritized according to business goals.

-   **Gathering Evidence**

Personas are representations of the users, so the more detailed the level of data used to shape them, the better. Post-validate the accuracy of the clusters identified in the previous step against facts, analytics data, interviews, etc.

For areas where no data or evidence exists, we can consider doing additional user research if necessary, employing methods such as surveys, focus groups, contextual inquiry, etc.

-   **Constructing and sharing the personas:**

Identify each cluster with a representative name, and add any missing details to complete the persona, along with other attributes, such as their goals, behaviors, and motivations.

It is important to present the personas to the entire team, along with scenarios, to illustrate how they are used.

User Journey Workshop
---------------------

During this workshop, the user's tasks and steps are analyzed to understand how they achieve their goals. In the case that goals aren't met, what opportunities exist to improve this process.

**What is needed for this workshop**

An overview of the existing screens or functionality should be provided for this workshop. These can be presented in as roadmaps, wireframes, flowcharts, funnels, or any other artifact that explicitly depicts the existing or potential user journeys.

**Who should attend this workshop**

-   **Project stakeholders**

They are the ones that need to agree on the design direction of the project. This can include both business and engineering people.

-   **The user experts**

They are the ones closer to the users and can provide information or data regarding their goals, pain points, and behavior patterns. It is desirable to integrate all different points of view at this stage, whether it is from a sales representative, customer support specialist, or a domain expert.

**What will happen during the workshop**

-   **Deconstructing the user journey: Task Analysis**

Task analysis is a way of examining the user journey steps and break them down into sets of small tasks that users go through to complete goals. Once this step is down, we can categorize the tasks by the type of effort required by the user, whether it is decision-making, wayfinding, error or problem solving, etc.

-   **Optimize the journey: Finding ways to remove or automate steps**

For each step, find out ways to eliminate unnecessary work for the user, *i.e.,* re-entering data, looping through multiple screens that could be simplified into one.

-   **Plan what needs to be done in the form of functionality requirements, content strategy, or changes to the existing site or app structure.**

All the ideas should be written down, even if they won't be implemented in the current iteration. Some suggestions might fall outside the scope of the project, so they could be communicated to whoever is in charge.

-   **Create prototypes to present the improved user journey.**

Mock-ups or quick prototypes should be created to visualize and communicate the new, improved journey.

KPIs Workshop
-------------

**Defining metrics of success**

Establishing outcome metrics should be done before the project starts. If metrics aren't set early in the process, we end up looking for data that fits the result in a later stage, when modifications are no longer possible or expensive. Instead, we could have used them during the project to generate optimal results and adjust accordingly.

This step could be its own workshop as we'd need them to describe what their success factors are so that the solution will be aligned with them. By doing this, it will be easier to prioritize work on future iterations based on metric performance.

(This also helps simplabs to better communicate the impact of our work for future case studies)

**Example of KPIs**

-   Task success rate
-   Time-on-task
-   User error rate
-   System usability scale
-   Customer Satisfaction scale
-   Churn Rate

**What will happen during this workshop?**

-   **Goals and objectives are defined**

What do we aim to change? E.g., turn existing users into customers.

-   **Critical success factors are identified**

What are the expected effects of that change? How much should they change so that we observe an effect?

E.g., 15% more users subscribe to a premium plan during their first 3 months

-   **Rationale, historical data, analytics**

Why do we think those changes will happen? What evidence do we have for that?

-   **How will the measures be collected**

How can we measure the effect? What are the leading indicators that we need to track?

### Brand and Visual Language Session

The client gives us an introduction to their brand, existing brand material, and visual guidelines. Based on this, we might or might not need to develop a new visual language, but instead find opportunities to improve the existing one.

We need to understand where the existing visual language exists and the risks and costs associated with changes.

**Assessing the effectiveness of the visual language**
------------------------------------------------------

If required, we can arrange activities to gain more insights into the visual language.

-   **Brand Perception Surveys**

We can uncover conflicts that exist between brand perception and identified the user or business needs. If for example, we have revealed that a lack of trust is blocking users from signing up, we might consider the brand elements effect on the user experience.

-   **Visual Design Evaluation (usability, accessibility)**

We can detect inconsistencies, problems with the fonts they are using (e.g., won't support some characters, hard to read), contrast is insufficient.

Based on the result of the evaluation the following are possible:

-   **The client doesn't need a complete visual redesign, but instead, we need to adapt the design system components to fit his visual language.**
-   **The client needs a redesign that will solve the problems identified during the evaluation.**

Design of Visual Language
------------------------------------------------------

Describe the actual process here.

Planning
========

Next we go to the planning phase; for the feature (set) defined and validated in the user journeys step, we think about whether time or scope is fixed for building this feature set (the only one can be fixed); if time is fixed, we try and identify aspects of the feature that could be scoped down if we have to later. We then try and give the customer an outlook for steps and overall duration (this is an estimate, not a deadline).

The design and the list of documents that came out of the user journeys step are the foundation for the implementation phase. Of course, they can change any time, but it's what we start with. <We could give this a name, e.g., the "bundle" or whatever>.

Implementation
==============

The implementation phase combines both implementing the design and writing the code. All of the work should be tracked on the same board, following our iteration approach we're already using and that's previously described in our playbook. In the first pass of the project, this could mean that engineering can only start with a slight delay as the designers need to prepare enough wireframes, so the engineers are not blocked. We do our normal iterations-based process and planning, creating specific issues based on them that we bundled in the planning step. During implementation, we keep a staging system updated so all stakeholders can follow along the process. We ask our clients to join the iteration meetings (). We will build slices of the system at once, that is the design, backend, and frontend code of something so we can release these three things together. This way, we can be sure they work together and move on to the next slice (see <https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-10#integrating-in-one-place> for a good explanation).

Post-launch
===========

Post-launch we can operate the system for the client and potentially also validate what we built works for users. Ideally, we'd be able to do this after every pass of the full-service phase.

Test and Validation
===================

Let's include something about user interview or similar mechanisms **after release** - a validation step in which we ensure that what we built is actually what users want.

**Testing with users**

Data analysis and survey methods can be used to determine a potential subset of users that would be most representative for testing. In this way, we can gather more valuable insights and feedback.

We would outline the right survey method to recruit potential test users, qualify them, and design the experiments.
